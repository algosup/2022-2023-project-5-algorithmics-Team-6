Week 1:

The project has commenced, and we have engaged a remote software engineer and tech lead named Christopher Diggins.
Established communication with Christopher via a Slack channel.
Objectives for this week: Create a rough draft of the functional specifications (assigned to Jason) and gain a better understanding of the project scope.

Week 2:

Completed the functional draft and forwarded it to the software engineer for further development.
The draft requires polishing before being sent to the client.

Objectives for next week: Finalize the Functional specifications and prepare a first draft of the technical specifications.

Week 3:

Functional specifications have been completed and shared with the client for feedback.
First version of the program is also finished and functional.
Christopher (our SE/TL) has joined the team, providing his expertise directly.
QA team has started testing but faces difficulties, awaiting Christopher's guidance.
Objectives for next week: Incorporate client feedback to finalize the functional specifications, receive an updated version of the technical specifications, and commence QA testing with Christopher's assistance.

Week 4:

Received client feedback on the functional specifications, made necessary modifications, and completed the functional requirements.
Christopher has arrived and enhanced our understanding of the project.
QA team began testing, identifying and reporting issues for resolution.
Technical specifications received in a different format, requiring conversion to meet client requirements (Markdown format).
Objectives for next week: Continue QA testing and address issues, make progress on the algorithm.

Week 5:

SE and TL will be unavailable this week, focusing on testing the existing software.
Limited team members available for work, prioritizing software testing.
Objectives for next week: Progress on the program and anticipate the final version of the technical specifications.

Week 6:

The program has become more stable and satisfactory.
Technical specifications have been converted to Markdown format and updated.
Awaiting a new version of the test plan with the updated program, anticipating the discovery of new issues.
Objectives for next week: Identify new issues in the test plan and begin preparations for the oral presentation.

Week 7:

As we enter the 7th week, our focus is on preparing the oral presentation scheduled for next week.
Prioritizing the completion of slides and initiating practice sessions for the presentation.
Considering the absence of our SE/TL during the presentation, we will receive their notes to cover their part.
